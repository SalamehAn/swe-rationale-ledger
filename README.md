# SWE Rational Ledger
This is a ledger to track the rationale of SWE, wherever possible.

Format of entries will be somewhere along the lines of:
    * Overall Context. For example: which stage of the SDLC? which phase of development?
    * Rationale. This will cover multiple grounds on an internal checklist I go over, that I iterate on to make exhaustive. Note that this will contain context, as rationale will be derived from the context.
    * Outcome.

Note that these anecdotes/entries are not objective by any means. I don't believe there are many things that are generalizable in the field of software engineering. This is mainly due to the discipline essentially responding to human need, and said human need varies by people, time, society, among other factors. What fits for one scenario might not fit for the other.

One might raise the question: then why do I even track these entries? Well the rationale here is:
1. When one is conscious about the driving factors behind his rationalizing process, he can create a checklist to go over when one really needs to think about the dimensions of the idea.
2. While the entries are heavily contextualized, one cannot help but consider the factor of repeating or similar scenarios to the entries being mentioned. In this case the entries could be used to draw analogies. This is does not disable the rationalizing process, but helps to provide how certain previous choices turned out, to further guide future decisions.

If entries accumulate, then access will become difficult. Therefore some categorizing scheme is needed. For this I will be using multiple tags to mark entries, these tags will be sourced from the multiple elements that comprise the structure of the entry. It could be from the overall context, from the rationale or the outcome. Now in order to have a uniform set of tags, so that accessibility is facilitated I will be using an internal framework for the multiple elements that could appear in the overall context, rationale, and outcomes.

Of course one must remember the legal nature of the topic, and that any SWE work, and the rationalizing that comes with that, that come from work in organizations will have some NDAs surrounding it, but this will be a point of future consideration.

This is an attempt at the topic, and it is by no means fully mature, but an interesting experiment to see if something is born out of it.

I am by no means an experienced developer. But I cannot help but appreciate awareness in the work that I do, and a hunch of mine tells me that this will help me towards that end.
